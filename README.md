This is a short game where you play as a person living in a small room with a stuffed rabbit toy they have had since they were very small, and a window that looks out on an extremely desolate wasteland with only a sphere. I started creating the game by making the sprites and backgrounds. Then I added everything to the project (I had to learn how to add images into p5.js). I wanted the game to feel kind of wistful or lonely, but it didn’t really capture the feeling I was aiming for until I added a little song that I made (I stole a lot of the song’s inspiration and melodies from "No Surprises" by Radiohead).I added the sphere for two reasons: first, because I wanted to learn geometries in p5.js; and second, because I wanted there to be an object that was—although not explained in the game—giving light to the room. I named it "Spherey," quite frankly, because I wanted to add more text and didn’t know what else to include—and because I was bored. I learned a lot while doing this assignment, had fun, and created something I’m pretty happy with.
